    "### 4.1 The network delay\n",
    "- Let's recap the core concepts up to Chapter 3, we have:\n",
    "    - Created a monetary system that allows participants to transfer money between one another\n",
    "    - Ensured that participants can ony spend their own money by using an *unforgeable crypto signature scheme* to authenticate transactions\n",
    "    - Enabled that participants can determine *who owns what* via gossiping transactions through the network, upon verification, into a *transaction graph* & reading the *UTXO set*. Note that the latter is the only thing that determines who owns what whereas the former just stores the history of past value transfer\n",
    "- Our assumption is that since every transaction is gossiped everyone will eventually arrive at the same transaction graph and reach consensus on the UTXO set\n",
    "    - The order at which transactions arrive wrt some honest node doesn't matter as long as they are gossiped within some time $\\Delta$\n",
    "    - **Definition 13** (Network delay). The network delay parameter $\\Delta$ measure the maximum time it takes for a message to travel from one honest party to every other one on the network"
