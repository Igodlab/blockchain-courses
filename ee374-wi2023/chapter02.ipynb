    "- Because of Pigeonhole theorem ie. if the universe of preimage is larger than hash image then collisions will exist\n",
    "    - **Theorem 2** (Pigeonhole). *Consider a function $f:A\\rightarrow B$. If $|A|>|B|$, then there must exist some inputs $x_1, x_2$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$*\n",
    "    - thus, **collisions** are inevitable, some algorithms to find the problematic inputs are\n",
    "        - start feeding inputs to $H$, starting w/ $x=0$ and going up to $2^\\kappa-1$, if there hasn't been a collision until then $\\Rightarrow$ we are certain that the next input will yield a collision\n",
    "        - Brute force search, runs in exponential time $2^{2\\kappa}$ where we use two for loops one for $x_i$ and the other for $x_j$ aiming to find $(i,j)\\wedge H(x_i)=H(x_j)$\n",
    "        - *Collision-finding game* - initialize the adversary $x_1,x_2\\leftarrow\\mathcal{A}(1^\\kappa)$ and let her produce two different inputs (she may have them hard coded) that have the same $\\kappa$-bit output hash $H_\\kappa(x_1)=H_\\kappa(x_2)\\wedge x_1\\neq x_2$\n",
    "        \n",
    "- From the last point, the adversary may have a list of hard coded collisions, but for sufficiently large values of $\\kappa$ ie. more secure hash function, these may not work\n",
    "    - **Definition 5** (Collision Resistance). *A hash function $H:\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$ is collision resistant if:* $\\forall\\text{PPT}\\mathcal{A} : P[\\text{collision-game}_{H,\\mathcal{A}}(\\kappa)=1]\\leq\\text{negl}(\\kappa)$\n",

    "#### Preimage resistance\n",
    "- In preimage resistance $\\mathcal{A}$ is provided a hash output and should be unfeasible to find the preimage $x$ that produces such hash\n",

    "\n",
    "- As we can see there is some deductive hierarchy in strength of theorems:\n",
    "    - **Theorem 3** (Collision Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ 2nd Preimage Resistance). *If a hash function $H$ is collision resistant, then it is 2nd-preimage resistant*\n",
    "    - **Theorem 4** (2nd Preimage Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ Preimage Resistance). *If a hash funciton $H$ is 2nd-preimage resistant, then it is preimage resistant*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *Soft intuitive proofs*:\n",
    "    - Theorem 4 - suppose another $\\mathcal{A}$ that can break $H$ in 2nd-preimage and serves $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ in its mission to break collision. First, $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ chooses $x_1\\sim P_\\text{uniform}$ from the message space and then hands it to $\\mathcal{A}$ who, based in our assumption, achieves Definition 7 producing an $x_2$ such that $x_1\\neq x_2 \\wedge H(x_1)=H(x_2)$. Then, returns this output to $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ who produces the final output $(x_1,x_2)$\n",

    "#### Gossiping with hashses\n",
    "- Collision resistance ensures that objects are uniquely *content-addressible*\n",
    "- Hashes are so useful that allow to advertise unique objects without revealing its contents\n",
    "- In the gossiping process, instead of sending the whole object to peers it is more efficient to advertise its hash (*objectid*)\n",
    "    - If a peer is already aware of the object, then they can simply ignore it. If not they can request the object through its *objectid* and verify its hash upon delivery\n",
    "    - Moreover, gossiping w/ hashes allows anonymity ie. $B$ doesn't have a way of knowing if object $O$ was generated by $A$'s IP addr or simply relayed.\n",
