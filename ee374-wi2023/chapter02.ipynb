    "### 2.1 Hash functions\n",
    "- So we've seen that in the *gossip protocol* nodes exchange information objects, its essential to label them with a unique identifier\n",
    "    - Since there is no notion of ordering while the protocol is running we discard counting and also random numbers because we want uniqueness\n",
    "    - Then we use hashes as unique identifiers: $H:\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$ which take whatever sized string and output a $\\kappa$-bits long string\n",
    "    - *Cryptographic hashes* are great *compression* functions that also are polynomially computable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision resistance\n",
    "- Ideally we'd like to have a unique hash for any object: $\\forall x_1,x_2:x_1\\neq x_2\\Rightarrow H(x_1)\\neq H(x_2)$\n",
    "- However, this is unattainable because there is finite hash outputs and unlimited possible inputs\n",
    "    - **collisions** are inevitable, ie. if we start feeding inputs to $H$, starting w/ $x=0$ and going up to $2^\\kappa-1$, if there hasn't been a collision until then $\\Rightarrow$ we are certain that the next input will yield a collision\n",
