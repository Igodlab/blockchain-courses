    "- Because of Pigeonhole theorem ie. if the universe of preimage is larger than hash image then collisions will exist\n",
    "    - **Theorem 2** (Pigeonhole). *Consider a function $f:A\\rightarrow B$. If $|A|>|B|$, then there must exist some inputs $x_1, x_2$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$*\n",
    "    - thus, **collisions** are inevitable, some algorithms to find the problematic inputs are\n",
    "        - start feeding inputs to $H$, starting w/ $x=0$ and going up to $2^\\kappa-1$, if there hasn't been a collision until then $\\Rightarrow$ we are certain that the next input will yield a collision\n",
    "        - Brute force search, runs in exponential time $2^{2\\kappa}$ where we use two for loops one for $x_i$ and the other for $x_j$ aiming to find $(i,j)\\wedge H(x_i)=H(x_j)$\n",
    "        - *Collision-finding game* - initialize the adversary $x_1,x_2\\leftarrow\\mathcal{A}(1^\\kappa)$ and let her produce two different inputs (she may have them hard coded) that have the same $\\kappa$-bit output hash $H_\\kappa(x_1)=H_\\kappa(x_2)\\wedge x_1\\neq x_2$\n",
    "        \n",
    "- From the last point, the adversary may have a list of hard coded collisions, but for sufficiently large values of $\\kappa$ ie. more secure hash function, these may not work\n",
    "    - **Definition 5** (Collision Resistance). *A hash function $H:\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$ is collision resistant if:* $\\forall\\text{PPT}\\mathcal{A} : P[\\operatorname{collision-game}_{H,\\mathcal{A}}(\\kappa)=1]\\leq\\text{negl}(\\kappa)$\n",

    "#### Preimage resistance\n",
    "- In preimage resistance $\\mathcal{A}$ is provided a hash output and should be unfeasible to find the preimage $x$ that produces such hash\n",
    "    - **Defintion 6** (Preimage Resistance). *A hash function $H:\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$ is preimage resistant if* $\\forall\\text{PPT}\\mathcal{A}: P[\\operatorname{preimage-game}_{H,\\mathcal{A}}(\\kappa)=1]\\leq\\text{negl}(\\kappa)$\n",

    "\n",
    "- As we can see there is some deductive hierarchy in strength of theorems:\n",
    "    - **Theorem 3** (Collision Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ 2nd Preimage Resistance). *If a hash function $H$ is collision resistant, then it is 2nd-preimage resistant*\n",
    "    - **Theorem 4** (2nd Preimage Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ Preimage Resistance). *If a hash funciton $H$ is 2nd-preimage resistant, then it is preimage resistant*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *Intuitive soft proofs*:\n",
    "    - Theorem 4 (by contradiction) - suppose another $\\mathcal{A}$ that can break $H$ in 2nd-preimage and serves $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ in its mission to break collision. First, $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ chooses $x_1\\sim P_\\text{uniform}$ from the message space and then hands it to $\\mathcal{A}$ who, based in our assumption, overcomes Definition 7 w/ non-negligible prob, producing an $x_2$ such that $x_1\\neq x_2 \\wedge H(x_1)=H(x_2)$. Then, returns this output to $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ who produces the final output $(x_1,x_2)$. If $\\mathcal{A}$ breaks 2nd-preimage w/ non-negligible prob then $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ will break collision w/ non-negligible prob as well. However, because both $\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ are PPT this contradicts the assumption that $H$ is collision resistant $\\square$\n",

    "#### Gossiping with hashses\n",
    "- Collision resistance ensures that objects are uniquely *content-addressible*\n",
    "- Hashes are so useful that allow to advertise unique objects without revealing its contents\n",
    "- In the gossiping process, instead of sending the whole object to peers it is more efficient to advertise its hash (*objectid*)\n",
    "    - If a peer is already aware of the object, then they can simply ignore it. If not they can request the object through its *objectid* and verify its hash upon delivery\n",
    "    - Moreover, gossiping w/ hashes allows anonymity ie. $B$ doesn't have a way of knowing if object $O$ was generated by $A$'s IP addr or simply relayed.\n",

    "#### Hash security \n",
    "- Because collision resistance is the stronger resistance proof its the only requisite to call a hash function *cryptographically secure*\n",
    "    - **Definition 8** (Secure Hash Function). *A hash function $\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$ is secure if there is a negligible function $\\text{negl}$ such that:* $\\forall\\text{PPT}\\mathcal{A}: P[\\text{collision-game}_{H,\\mathcal{A}}=1]\\leq\\text{negl}$\n",

    "### 2.2 Signatures\n",
    "- Signatures are used to prove to the rest of the network that a balance transfer was really authorized by the sender. Signatures are part of a *cryptographic scheme*, which is a protocol used to achieve certain security objectives\n",
    "#### Public key cryptograpy\n",
    "- Lets state the distinction between identity in legacy and blockchain systems\n",
    "    - *Legacy* - identity is tied to a person as info in the government's database and has a correspondent physical card (passport) that is accepted\n",
    "    - *Blockchain* - identity can be *pseudonymous* and an actor can have multiple ones. Idenity is a tuple of a private $sk$ and public key $pk$\n",
    "        - for any identity there is a tuple of uniquely related $sk$ and $pk$ \n",
    "        - given a private key, it is easy to get the respective public key. Given a public key, it is hard to get the respective private key\n",
    "#### Unforgetability\n",
    "- A special algorithm $\\operatorname{Gen}(1^\\kappa)$ creates the key pair $(sk,pk)$ which are $\\kappa$-bits long strings each\n",
    "- A function $\\operatorname{Sig}(pk, m)=\\sigma$ can create unique signatures from a private key $pk$: a particular signature $\\sigma$ is related to a particular message $m$ (a different message $m^\\prime$ is associated w/ a different signature $\\sigma^\\prime$)\n",
    "    - A receiver of message $m$ can invoke a boolean function $\\operatorname{Ver}(pk, m, \\sigma)$ to check the veracity of the message and if was truly produced by the sender (whose pub key is $pk$)\n",
    "    - **Definition 9** (Signature Correctness). *Consider a signature scheme $(\\operatorname{Gen}, \\operatorname{Sig}, \\operatorname{Ver})$. The scheme is correct if for any key pair $(pk,sk)$ generated by invoking $\\operatorname{Gen}$, and $\\forall m$ it holds that $\\operatorname{Ver}(pk,m,\\operatorname{Sig}(sk,m))=\\text{true}$*\n",
    "- An adversary trying to break the cryptographic scheme may have the following (incremental) power \n",
    "    - Invoke $\\operatorname{Gen}$ blindly knowing $pk$ and try to decipher $sk^\\mathcal{A}=sk$\n",
    "    - Inspect previous messages $m$ signed by $(pk, sk)$ to try to decipher $sk^\\mathcal{A}=sk$\n",
    "    - Make the honest party sign messages produced by the adversary $m^\\mathcal{A}$ in conjunction to the two above to try to decipher $sk^\\mathcal{A}=sk$"
