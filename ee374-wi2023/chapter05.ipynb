    "# Chapter 5\n",
    "# The Chain \n",
    "- In the last chapter we've introduced a way for preventing double spends by enforcing periods of silence via a ticketing system that occurs at tunable frequency and its earned by mining Proof of Work\n",
    "- We also required a notion of freshness from block to block to avoid tricking the system by withholding and spamming blocks at will\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 The Target\n",
    "- Now that we've established the PoW inequality (as a moderately hard version of the expentially hard hash preimage problem) we'd like to estimate what the *difficulty param* $T$ should be to have $\\Delta$ spacing between ticket/block to ticket/block\n",
    "    - *Random oracle assumption* - Since the distribution of the image set of hash functions are not always uniform, for PoW we'd like to demand that they are uniformly distributed in $\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$\n",
    "    - Guessing the right $\\text{ctr}$ (in $B=s\\|\\vec{x}\\|\\text{ctr}$) for wining PoW has a probability of success of: $p=P[H(B)\\leq T]=\\frac{T}{2^\\kappa}$\n",
    "    - Lets assume that: *(i)* a node with typical computational power can process $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$ computations of $H$ per unit of time. *(ii)* There is $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ computers in the network out of which the adversary controls $t\\in\\mathbb{N}$ (a more powerful computer can be thought as a collection of smaller computers with multiplicative power of $q\\times\\text{some-int-number}$)\n",
    "- The expected number of queries until a successful query is $\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{2^\\kappa}{T}$, if the total number of queries that can be executed in the network is $nq$ then the expected block generation time is $\\frac{1}{pnq}=\\frac{2^\\kappa}{Tnq}$, we require this to be greater than network delay: $\\Delta<\\frac{2^\\kappa}{Tnq}\\Rightarrow T<\\frac{2^\\kappa}{\\Delta nq}$\n",
    "    - The more computational power there is on the network the more we have to increase mining difficulty, and same applies if we want to delay the network paramenter\n",
    "    - Lets define the *honest block production rate* $f$ and the expected time between two blocks being generated: $\\eta=\\frac{1}{f}$\n",
    "        - *static difficulty model* - For now we can make use of a static/fixed $f\\simeq (n-t)qp$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 The Arrow of Time\n",
    "- The chain structure is a consecuence of our intention of forcing *freshness* so that blocks from the past can't be saved and used at will. Turns out that the chain structure has more interesting properties that we'll discuss here\n",
    "    - First lets introduce some notation, a chain $\\mathcal{C}$ is a sequence of $n$ blocks $\\mathcal{C}=(B_0,B_1,\\ldots,B_{n-1})$ which has length $\\left|\\mathcal{C}\\right|$ & is enumerated like arrays in Python starting at zero and going up to $n-1$\n",
    "        - Like Python, the first **Genesis Block** is $\\mathcal{G}=\\mathcal{C}[0]$ & the tip is $\\mathcal{C}[-1]=\\mathcal{C}[|\\mathcal{C}|-1]$\n",
    "        - A chunk of the chain from the $i$-th (incluse) to the $j$-th (exclusive) element is $\\mathcal{C}[i:j]=(B_i,\\ldots,B_{j-1})$ \n",
    "- Now lets elaborate on how a block is *validated* and which other security notions against adversarial attacks are needed\n",
    "    - Analogously to *simple ideas* do not work (Sec.4.3) for avoiding double spending in transactions, simple ideas for validating blocks also don't work eg. the idea of *\"A fresh block  must extend the most recent block weâ€™ve seen. If we receive a fresh block, we accept it. Otherwise we reject it as unfresh\"* will easily fail, creating blocktrees\n",
    "    - *Blocktrees* - An adversary can still create split truth scenarios eg. from Fig.5.1 party-5 could hold a block (red) just enoguh time $t_A$ before a new party-6 broadcasts his (actually legitimate) next freshest block. Then if party-7 receives the red block (paty-5's) before party-6's block at $t_B$ (because $t_B-t_A=\\Delta$, theres enough spacing to traverse the network) he would split the chain, and even worse yet reject party-6's block afterwards (Fig.5.2)\n",

    "    \n",
    "- We can use the *lenght of a chain* as a reference parameter because its correlated to the time it took to produce it\n",
    "    - **Longest Chain Rule**. Among the all chains on the network adopt the longest chain (the one w/ most blocks) as the *canonical chain*. If there are multiple competing chains w/ the same length choose any chain arbitrarily\n",
    "    - What we have now is a worse but will lead us in the right direction. Summarized, the steps that an honest party follows are: *1)* Maintain a local canonical chain $\\mathcal{C}$. *(2)* keep mining on that chain. *(3)* if mining is successful, braodcast the new block and update the local canonical chain. *(4)* if not keep mining. *(5)* in the meantime check the length of any new incoming chain, if its longer then *reorg* and **roll back** blocks as needed\n",
    "    - Lets introduce some notation, $B.\\vec{x}$ is the sequence of transactions component of $B=s\\|\\vec{x}\\|\\text{ctr}$. We say that $B\\in\\mathcal{C}$ belonging to a particular chain history and the Ledger set is initialized as empty $[]$\n",
    "    - Recall the *read* functionality of a Ledger, we can now construct the basic algo (incomplete and naive until Chap.6 but workable)\n",
