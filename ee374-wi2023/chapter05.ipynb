    "- In the last chapter we've introduced a way for preventing double spends by enforcing periods of silence via a ticketing system that occurs at tunable frequency and its earned by mining Proof of Work\n",

    "- Now that we've established the PoW inequality (as a moderately hard version of the expentially hard hash preimage problem) we'd like to estimate what the *difficulty param* $T$ should be to have $\\Delta$ spacing between ticket/block to ticket/block\n",
    "    - *Random oracle assumption* - Since the distribution of the image set of hash functions are not always uniform, for PoW we'd like to demand that they are uniformly distributed in $\\{0,1\\}^\\kappa$\n",
    "    - Guessing the right $\\text{ctr}$ (in $B=s\\|\\vec{x}\\|\\text{ctr}$) for wining PoW has a probability of success of: $p=P[H(B)\\leq T]=\\frac{T}{2^\\kappa}$\n",
    "    - Lets assume that: *(i)* the node with typical computational power can process $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$ computations of $H$ per unit of time. *(ii)* Theres $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ computers in the network out of which the adversary controls $t\\in\\mathbb{N}$ (a more powerful computer can be thought as a collection of smaller computers with multiplicative power of $q\\times\\text{some-int-number}$)\n",
    "- The expected number of queries until a successful query is $\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{2^\\kappa}{T}$, if the total number of queries that can be executed in the network is $nq$ then the expected block generation time is $\\frac{1}{pnq}=\\frac{2^\\kappa}{Tnq}$, we require this to be greater than $\\Delta$:\n",
